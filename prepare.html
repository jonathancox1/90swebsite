                        At its basics, espresso is created by forcing water thorugh finly ground coffee upwards of 9bars or 130pounds per square inch.
                        The resulting liquid is called espresso.  Any coffee can be prepared in an expresso machine to make espresso.  Here a pump is
                        utilized to generate the pressure.

                        Where espresso all started.  The lever, actuated by the user, is what generates the pressure on the coffee.  Because of this
                        the design is inherently simpler.  This is where the phrase 'pull a shot' comes from.

                        Ground coffee and water are steeped together for a specified amount of time.  The container the liquid is in is then pressed,
                        to nearly stop the presing process, seperating the coffee ground from the liquid.
