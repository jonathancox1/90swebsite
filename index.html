                    The history of coffee dates back to the 15th century, and possibly earlier with a number of reports
                    and legends surrounding its first use. The earliest substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking
                    or knowledge of the coffee tree is from the early 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen,
                    spreading soon to Mecca and Cairo. By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East,
                    South India (Karnataka), Persia, Turkey, the Horn of Africa, and northern Africa. Coffee then spread
                    to the Balkans, Italy, and to the rest of Europe, as well as Southeast Asia and then to America,
                    despite bans imposed during the 15th century by religious leaders in Mecca and Cairo, and later by
                    the Catholic Church.
