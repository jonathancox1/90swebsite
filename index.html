                    Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the
                    Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these
                    beloved beans.

                    The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from
                    a certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.

                    Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a roast with the berries
                    and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his
                    discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to
                    spread.

                    As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring
                    these beans across the globe.
